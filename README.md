The *mipmapper* package contains a series of functions for analysing and visualising Molecular Inversion Probe (MIP) data. **This package is in early stages of development**, but will hopefully eventually include a range of population genetic analyses.

### Installation

In R, ensure that you have the devtools package installed by running
```r
install.packages("devtools")
```
Then simply install and load the *mipmapper* package directly from GitHub by running
```r
devtools::install_github("mrc-ide/mipmapper")
library(mipmapper)
```
