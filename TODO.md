### TODO Functionality list:

---
  
1. Dummy dataset creation function, for ease of examples/tests etc.
2. Dataset checking function. Something that looks for needed variables, and 
either identifies them intelligently or the user provides their locations.
3. Shiny interface for loading a dataset, sliders for filtering, and then 
displayed plots.
